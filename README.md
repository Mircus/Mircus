# 👋 Hi, I'm Mirco A. Mannucci

I'm a **polymath**, **AI researcher**, **applied mathematician**, and **innovation architect**.  
My work explores the frontiers between symbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning, geometry and cognition, and classical and quantum computation.

I believe in **human-augmenting AI** – not to replace us, but to deepen our capacity to think, act, and evolve.

## 🧠 Areas of Focus

- **Transformers and Explainability** – Spectral pruning, random matrix theory, SVD analysis
- **Quantum Information and Geometry** – Weak values, superoscillations, Qiskit simulations
- **Mathematical Structures in AI** – Simplicial sets, Clifford algebras, category theory
- **Cognitive AI Architectures** – LangChain agents with long-term memory and reasoning chains
- **Generative Intelligence** – Tools that elaborate raw ideas into structured mathematical form

## 📜 Philosophy

> "Mathematics is not a tool for science. It is the *language of Reality* itself."

I'm interested in how high-level abstractions can guide intelligence, both human and artificial. I explore connections between **phenomenology, formal logic, and neural computation**, with a pragmatic engineering attitude.
